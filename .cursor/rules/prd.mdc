*   Users who feel overwhelmed by their inbox and struggle to keep up with important communications.
*   Privacy-conscious users seeking a secure email management solution.

## 4. Scope and Features

### 4.1. Core Features

*   **Automated Inbox Triage:**
    *   Intelligently categorizes incoming emails (e.g., newsletters, marketing, financial alerts, project updates, personal).
    *   Allows users to define actions per category:
        *   None (Keep as unread)
        *   Mark as Read
        *   Archive
        *   Trash
        *   Mark as Spam
    *   AI analyzes sender, subject, content, and email cues for categorization.
    *   Triage occurs automatically before the user opens their inbox.

*   **Curated Weekly Briefings (Digests):**
    *   Users can select specific email categories to include in a weekly digest.
    *   AI intelligently summarizes each email within the chosen categories, extracting core information.
    *   A single, weekly email compiles these smart summaries.
    *   Digests are sent to the user's primary or default email account.

*   **Secure Email Account Connection:**
    *   Supports connecting Google email accounts via OAuth.
    *   Supports connecting other email accounts via IMAP/SMTP credentials.
    *   Industry-standard encryption for credentials and tokens.
*   **Ironclad Security & Privacy:**
    *   Email data processed and temporarily stored by Jupiter Mail is encrypted on secure servers.
    *   Strict 14-day data retention policy: all processed email content is automatically and permanently purged from systems after two weeks.

### 4.2. User Interface & Experience

*   **Landing Page:**
    *   Clearly communicates product value, features, and benefits.
    *   Provides clear calls-to-action for signup/login.

*   **Settings Page:**
    *   Manage connected email accounts (add, remove, view status).
    *   Configure category preferences for triage (action per category).
    *   Configure category preferences for weekly digests (include/exclude per category).
    *   Option to test email categorization on recent emails from a connected account.
*   **Account Management Page:**
    *   List of connected email accounts.
    *   Status of each account (e.g., active, sync status).
    *   Option to connect new accounts (Google OAuth or IMAP/SMTP).
    *   Option to test connection for IMAP/SMTP accounts.
    *   Option to remove connected accounts.

### 4.3. Technical Features

    *   AI-powered engine to generate concise summaries of email content for digests.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

*   Sending emails directly from the Jupiter Mail interface (it's a management tool, not a full email client).
*   Advanced custom rule creation beyond category-based actions.
*   Mobile application (web-first approach).
*   Support for email providers other than Google (OAuth) and generic IMAP/SMTP initially.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   Number of active users.
*   Number of emails processed and triaged daily.
*   Number of weekly digests generated and sent.
*   User engagement with settings and preference customization.
