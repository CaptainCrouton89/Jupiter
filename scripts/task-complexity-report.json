      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the attachment handling implementation into logical phases covering storage setup, UI development, backend integration, and error handling. Focus on separating concerns between storage configuration, frontend components, and backend processing logic.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both frontend and backend work with Supabase Storage integration. It requires file handling, validation, UI components for different views, and proper error handling. The complexity comes from managing the full lifecycle of attachments across multiple contexts (composing, viewing, forwarding) while ensuring proper storage and retrieval."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the real-time notifications implementation into core functional areas: Supabase Realtime configuration, notification state management, UI components, and user preference settings. Consider the technical challenges of each area separately.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires setting up Supabase Realtime, creating a notification system with React Context, and building various UI components. While conceptually straightforward, it involves multiple technologies working together and has several optional features that add complexity. The integration between realtime events and the frontend notification system is the most challenging aspect."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the search functionality implementation focusing on the database configuration, query optimization, UI components, and advanced filtering features. Separate the core search capability from the enhanced features like highlighting and saved searches.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the need for PostgreSQL full-text search configuration, performance optimization for large datasets, and implementation of advanced search features. Creating efficient search across multiple email fields while maintaining good performance requires careful database design and query optimization. The UI components for search filters and results display add additional complexity."
