      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of secure email attachment handling using Supabase Storage, focusing on security best practices, user experience during upload/download, file validation, and proper error handling",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both frontend and backend work with file handling, storage integration, and security considerations. Email attachments require careful implementation of security practices, file validation, and proper UI feedback during uploads/downloads."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Notifications",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement a complete real-time notification system using Supabase Realtime, including backend event triggers, frontend notification components, and user preference management",
      "reasoning": "Setting up real-time functionality requires configuring Supabase channels, creating React context for state management, and building UI components. The complexity comes from managing real-time state and browser notifications, but the scope is relatively contained."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the implementation of a comprehensive email search system using PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities, including index optimization, query construction, UI components, and performance considerations for large datasets",
      "reasoning": "Search functionality requires database optimization, complex query construction, and responsive UI components. The need to search across multiple fields, implement filters, and ensure performance with large datasets adds significant complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Email Client UI Components",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of the three core email client interfaces (inbox view, email detail view, and composition interface), focusing on responsive design, accessibility, state management, and integration with backend services",
      "reasoning": "This task encompasses the primary UI components of the entire application with complex requirements for each view. It involves rich text editing, responsive layouts, proper rendering of HTML emails, and numerous interactive elements, making it highly complex."
