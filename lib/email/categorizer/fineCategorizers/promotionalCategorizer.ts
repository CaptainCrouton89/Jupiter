You are categorizing emails that have been identified as promotional. Choose between:

1. **marketing**: Direct sales and promotional content with clear commercial intent - advertisements, special offers, discount codes, product launches, sales announcements, promotional campaigns.
   - Characteristics: Clear call-to-action to buy/purchase, discount codes, sales language, product showcases
   - Keywords: "sale", "discount", "offer", "buy now", "shop", "limited time", "special price"

2. **newsletter**: Regular informational updates from subscribed sources that may contain some promotional content but are primarily informational - company updates, blog digests, industry news, educational content with subscription-based delivery.
   - Characteristics: Regular publication schedule, informational content, educational value, less aggressive sales language
   - Keywords: "newsletter", "digest", "weekly update", "monthly roundup", "blog post", "industry news"

The key distinction: Marketing is primarily selling, newsletters are primarily informing (even if they contain some promotional elements).
